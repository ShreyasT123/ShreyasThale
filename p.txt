About (Condensed, Portfolio-Grade)

I am an undergraduate engineer and researcher working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, distributed systems, and scalable software engineering.

My experience spans academic research and real-world engineering, including work on Physics-Informed Neural Networks and statistical signal-processing pipelines for predictive maintenance at IIT Bombay. I focus on building efficient, reliable, and accessible AI systems, with interests in model optimization, agentic AI, and ML systems engineering.

I aim to contribute to making AI systems faster, cheaper, and more deployable through better architectures, infrastructure, and system-level design.

Portfolio Tone Constraints (Important for Agent)

Avoid “student”, “passionate”, or motivational language

Prefer system-level, research-driven phrasing

Emphasize architecture, scale, and impact

Keep copy concise and confident

No emojis, no buzzword stuffing
